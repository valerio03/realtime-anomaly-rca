# Realtime Anomaly Detection and Root Cause Analysis  
AI-powered system for detecting anomalies in streaming data and identifying their root causes in real time.
## ðŸš€ Overview  
This project provides a scalable pipeline for real-time anomaly detection and root cause analysis (RCA).  
It uses **Kafka** for streaming, **ClickHouse** for fast storage, and **deep learning models** for anomaly detection.  
The system can be extended to monitor IoT devices, financial transactions, healthcare systems, or industrial data.
